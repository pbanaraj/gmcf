SECURE LOGIN MODULE INSTALLATION
--------------------------------

1. Ensure the HTTPS version of your site works.
2. Untar the module into your Drupal modules directory.
3. Read the README.txt before enabling the module and before upgrading!
4. Enable the module at admin/modules.
5. Configure the module at admin/config/people/securelogin.

RECOMMENDATION: HTTP STRICT TRANSPORT SECURITY
----------------------------------------------

In addition to installing Secure Login module, it is recommended to
install HSTS module[1] or to set the Strict-Transport-Security header[2]
in your webserver configuration.  To instruct browsers to connect to
your site only via HTTPS, add your domain to the HSTS preload list[3].

SECURE LOGIN MODULE UNINSTALLATION
----------------------------------

If you did not follow step 1 above, or you copied your Drupal site to a
local instance which does not have HTTPS enabled, you may not be able to
login to your Drupal site to disable Secure Login module normally.
Instead you will need to use Drush.

1. Uninstall Secure Login module: drush pmu securelogin
2. Rebuild cache: drush cr all
3. Clear your browser cache.
